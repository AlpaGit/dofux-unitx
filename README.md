For now I will focus to make the game work in solo and then add the multiplayer features.

For now I didn't figure out how to reproduce the bones system of Dofus using the swf files so I'm only using monsters and npc, everything in the Bones 1 is not usable for now

The maps are pre-built as Scene (1 map = 1 scene) in editor mod to avoid calculation during runtime, only the Astrub subarea is built to avoid too much disk size but everything is buildable
